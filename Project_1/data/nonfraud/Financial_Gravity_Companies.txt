their clients. 

Brokerage and wealth management services through Forta and money
management and investment advisory services through Sofos. Other products and services include insurance and other miscellaneous
products and services. 

Future growth is expected to come from these key areas, organic
growth, acquisitions, and strategic alliances. 

Business Acquisition and Disposition 

The Company acquired Forta in 2020 in exchange
for stock. Forta is a broker dealer, and its acquisition presented the Company with an opportunity to compete in the broker dealer
market, and to try to grow in this area of financial services. Forta also has key employees who assumed vital executive leadership
roles, including key executives who will focus on improving operations and growth opportunity. Forta also contributed key operating
assets, including in excess of 700,000 in cash, and annual revenues in excess of 3,000,000. 

The Company disposed of its tax unit. The
tax unit has the tax operating system, but that could be run more effectively by TMN, so the decision was made to transfer that
activity to the TMN. The tax unit was left with minor tax and accounting operations, and those activities did not present a significant
upside to the Company. 

Revenues 

For the year ended September 30, 2020, revenue decreased 387,568
to 3,687480 from 4,075,048 for the year ended September 30, 2019. The principal drivers for this are a decrease in revenue from
the discontinued tax operations of 649,830 and reduced revenue from reduction of the number of advisors at Sofos of 1,112,944,
as well as some minor non-recurring revenue at Financial Gravity, offset by an increase in revenue from Forta of 1,270,339, an
increase in revenue from TMN of 35,844, an increase of revenue from MPath of 73,882. The combined revenue for the Company includes
only the revenue from Forta since May 21, 2020. Forta generated in excess of 2 million of revenue from October 1, 2019 through
May 20, 2020 (the day prior to the acquisition of Forta). On a twelve-month pro forma basis that included Forta s revenue,
the Company would have generated in excess of 6,000,000 in revenue, or approximately 2,000,000 in annualized increased revenue.

Operating Expenses 

Cost of services increased by 18,144 to
 73,071 for the year ended September 30, 2020 from 54,927 for the year ended September 30, 2019, primarily due increased costs

fees at Forta of 93,095, an increase in professional fees at Financial Gravity of 321,761 (including adjustments in 2019 for
accrual of expenses that were greater than the fees incurred), offset by decreases in professional fees at Sofos of 73,793, at
TMN of 69,516, and at the discontinued tax practice of 43,526. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses

 22,282 to 166,586 for the year ended September 30, 2020 from 189,070 for the year ended September 30, 2019. The decrease is
primarily due to an increase of expense at Financial Gravity of 152,173 (including the full impairment of Trademarks 69,000),
offset by a decrease at TMN of 159,602, a small decrease at Sofos of 4,165, and a decrease at the discontinued tax practice of
 10,953. 

General and administrative expenses increased
 138,979 to 672,784 for the year ended September 30, 2020 from 533,805 for the year ended September 30, 2019. The increase is
primarily due increased costs at Forta of 275,272, and Financial Gravity, offset by decreases at other subsidiaries including
the discontinued tax department operations 163,452), Sofos reductions due to fewer advisors and at TMN aggregating approximately 250,000). 

Marketing expenses decreased 6,368 to 125,161 for the year ended
September 30, 2020 from 131,529 for the year ended September 30, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction of costs
at the discontinued tax operations of 22,788), and reductions in outside vendors by bringing marketing efforts in-house at TMN 76,678) and Sofos 15,838), offset by an increase in marketing expenses at Forta of 20,568, at Financial Gravity 85,110,
and at MPath 3300. The variance in expenses also reflects a change in marketing efforts influenced by Covid 19 restrictions that
shut down some previous marketing channels and a move toward the independent advisor model at Forta where advisors cover their
own marketing expenses. 

Compensation expenses decreased 315,438
to 3,186,305 for the year ended September 30, 2020 from 3,501,744 for the year ended September 30, 2019. The decrease is primarily
due to an increase in executive compensation at Financial Gravity of 1,580,121, the increase of compensation at Forta of 808,670
that includes commissions, and a small increase at MPath, offset by a decrease in compensation at the discontinued tax operations
of 1,023,467, Sofos of 917,359 that includes reduction in commissions, at TMN of 703,375 related to reduction in employees and
outsourced services and a move toward the independent advisor model at Forta where advisors cover their own marketing expenses. 

The Company experienced an increase in
net loss of 168,190 to a net loss of 791,675 for the year ended September 30, 2020 from a net loss of 623,485 for the year
ended September 30, 2019, primarily attributable to the reasons noted above. The variance in loss for the period also reflects
the impact of Covid-19 related reduction in marketing and face to face sales, which impacted revenues. This was offset by the
sale of the tax unit for 150,000.

Significant Accounting Policies 

Certain critical accounting policies affect
the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements.
These policies are contained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Use of Estimates and Assumptions. 

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable. 

Investment management fees are recognized
as services are provided by the Company. Investment management fees include fees earned from assets under management by providing
professional services to manage clients investments. Fees are generally paid quarterly, five days before each quarter-end
or monthly in arrears. Revenues are recognized in the period earned. 

The Company earns commission when it buys
and sells securities and various insurance products on behalf of its customers. Each time a customer enters into a buy or sell
transaction, the Company charges a commission. Commissions and related clearing expenses are recorded on the trade date (the date
that the Company fills the trade order by finding and contracting with a counterparty and confirms the trade with the customer),
and commission revenue from the sale of premiums on life insurance policies is recognized as received from the insurer, issuer. 

The Company generates services income which
is recognized as consulting and other professional services are performed by the Company. Income is recognized as services are
delivered. Revenue represents gross billings less discounts, net of sales tax, as applicable. Amounts invoiced for work not yet
completed are shown as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Trade accounts receivable are carried
only for investment management fees that are paid in arrears. The allowance for doubtful accounts was 0 and 0 as of September
30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit on an unsecured basis to its customers,
substantially all of whom are located in the United States of America. The Company does not believe that it is exposed to any significant
risk of loss on accounts receivable. 

The Company received revenue from Sofos

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the Company will need
additional financing to fund additional material capital expenditures and to fully implement its business plan. There are no assurances
that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all. If additional financing is not available, the Company
will need to reduce, defer or cancel development programs, planned initiatives and overhead expenditures as a way to supplement
the cash flows generated by operations. The Company has a backlog of fees under contract in addition to the Company s accounts
receivable balance. The failure to adequately fund its capital requirements could have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the sale of additional equity securities to raise financing will result
in additional dilution to the Company s stockholders and incurring additional indebtedness could involve the imposition of
covenants that restrict its operations. Management, in the normal course of business, is trying to raise additional capital through
sales of common stock as well as seeking financing from third parties, via both debt and equity, to balance the Company s
cash requirements and to finance specific capital projects.
