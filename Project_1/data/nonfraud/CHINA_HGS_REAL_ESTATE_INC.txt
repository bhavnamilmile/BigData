filings with the SEC. We therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements
in this report speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking
statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. These forward-looking statements include,
among other things, statements relating to: 

our ability to sustain our project development 

our ability to obtain additional land use rights at favorable prices; 

the market for real estate in Tier 3 and 4 cities and counties; 

our ability to obtain additional capital in future years to fund our planned expansion; or 

economic, political, regulatory, legal and foreign exchange risks associated with our operations. 

Our Business Overview 

We conduct substantially all of our business
through Shaanxi Guangsha Investment and Development Group Co., Ltd, in Hanzhong, Shaanxi Province. Since the initiation of our
business, we have been focused on expanding our business in certain Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and counties in China. 

For fiscal 2020, our sales and net loss
were approximately 13.0 million and 1.0 million, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately 67.5 and 73.5 from
fiscal 2019, respectively. The decrease in revenue, gross profit and net income was mainly due to less GFA sold during fiscal 2020. 

26 

For fiscal 2020, our average selling price ASP for real estate projects (excluding sales of parking spaces) located in Yang County was approximately 718
per square meter, consistent from ASP of 720 per square meter in fiscal 2019. The ASP of our Hanzhong real estate projects (excluding
sales of parking spaces) was approximately 419 per square meter for fiscal 2020, decreased by 25.2 as compared to the ASP of
 560 per square meter for fiscal 2019. The decrease ASP in Hanzhong real estate projects was mainly due to the fact that many units
sold in fiscal 2020 was for government s reallocation of residence purpose with lower ASP. 

Market Outlook 

In Fiscal 2019, the macro-economic backdrop
will continue to be uncertain with unrelenting downside pressure, while the overall inventory level of properties will remain high.
The central government will continue to adopt policies aimed to ensure stability, economic growth and improved employment. The
details of implementation by local government will vary among different PRC cities. 

In 2020, the Company expects to start the
construction of the real estate projects surrounding the Liangzhou Road area after the approval by the local government of the
road. These projects will comprise of residential for end-users and upgraders, shopping malls as well as serviced apartments and
offices to satisfy different market demands. Our customers continue to experience growth of their disposable income. With a lower
housing price to family disposable income ratio and an increasing urbanization level, there is a growing demand for high quality
residential housing. From this perspective, the Company is positive about the outlook for the local real estate market in a long
term. In the meantime, the Company is diversifying its revenue and developing more commercial and municipal projects. 

We intend to remain focused on our existing
construction projects in Hanzhong City and Yang County, deepening our institutional sales network, enhancing our cost and operational
synergies and improving cash flows and strengthening our balance sheet. In this respect, we began the construction of the following
large high rise residential projects in Hanzhong City and Yang County: 

Liangzhou road related projects 

In September 2013, the Company entered
into an agreement Liangzhou Agreement with the Hanzhong local government on the Liangzhou Road reformation and
expansion project (Liangzhou Road Project ). Pursuant to the agreement, the Company is contracted to reform and expand the
Liangzhou Road, a commercial street in downtown Hanzhong City, with a total length of 2,080 meters and width of 30 meters and to
resettle the existing residences in the Liangzhou road area. The government s original road construction budget was approximately
 33 million in accordance with the Liangzhou Agreement. The Company, in return, is being compensated by the local government to
have an exclusive right on acquiring at least 394.5 Mu land use rights in a specified location of Hanzhong City. The Liangzhou
Road Project s road construction started at the end of 2013. In 2014, the original scope and budget on the Liangzhou road
reformation and expansion project was extended, because the local government included more area and resettlement residences into
the project, which resulted in additional investments from the Company. In return, the Company is authorized by the local government
to develop and manage the commercial and residential properties surrounding the Liangzhou Road project. As of September 30,
2020, the main Liangzhou road construction is substantially completed, due to the complicated multiple level of government review
process. Since the Company started land leveling and construction process for the Oriental Garden Phase II and Liangzhou Mansion
real estate properties in the Liangzhou road real estate project in September, 2020, the Company expected to the government s
acceptance to be completed before the end of fiscal 2021. The Company s development cost incurred on Liangzhou Road Project
is treated as the Company s deposit on purchasing the related land use rights, as agreed by the local government. As of September 30,
2020, the actual costs incurred by the Company were 164,879,955 (September 30, 2019 - 146,958,903) and the incremental cost
related to residence resettlement approved by the local government. 

The Liangzhou Road related projects mainly
consists Oriental Garden Phase II, Liangzhou Mansion and Pearl Commercial Plaza surrounding the Liangzhou road area. The Company
started land leveling and construction process for the Oriental Garden Phase II and Liangzhou Mansion real estate properties in
the Liangzhou road real estate project in September, 2020. 

27 

Oriental Garden Phase II 
 
 Oriental Garden Phase II project is planned
 to consist of 8 high-rise residential buildings and 6 commercial buildings with total planned GFA of 370,298 square meters. The
 project will also include a farmer s market. 

Liangzhou Mansion 
 
 Liangzhou Mansion project is planned to
 consist of 7 high-rise building and commercial shops on the first floor with total planned GFA of 160,000 square meters. 

Pearl Commercial Plaza 
 
 Pearl Commercial Plaza is planned to consist
 one office building, one service apartment (or hotel), classical architecture style of Chinese traditional houses and shopping
 malls with total planned GFA of 124,191 square meters. 

The Company plans to start these three
real estate projects after the road construction passes local government s inspection and approval. These related projects
may take 2-3 years to fully complete. 

Road Construction 

Other road construction projects mainly
included a Yang County East 2nd Ring Road construction project. The Company was engaged by the Yang County local government to
construct the East 2nd Ring Road with a total length of 2.15 km. The local government is required to repay the Company s
project investment costs within 3 years with interest at the interest rate based on the commercial borrowing rate with the similar
term published by China construction bank September 30, 2020 and 2019 - 4.75 ). The local government has approved a refund
to the Company by reducing local surcharges or taxes otherwise required in the real estate development. The road construction was
substantially completed as of September 30, 2020 and in process of government review and approval. 

In September 2012, the Company was
approved by the Hanzhong local government to construct four municipal roads with a total length of approximately 1,192 meters.
The project was deferred and then restarted during the quarter ended March 31, 2014. As of September 30, 2020, the local
government was still in the process of assessing the budget for these projects.

Our revenues are derived from the sale
of residential buildings, commercial store-fronts and parking spaces in projects that we have developed. Comparing to last year,
revenues before sales tax decreased by 3.1 to approximately 13.0 million in fiscal 2020 from approximately 13.4 million in fiscal
2019. The total GFA sold during fiscal 2020 was 21,735 square meters, consistent from the 22,339 square meters sold during last
year. Currently, our Mingzhu Garden Phase I and Phase II, Yangzhou Pearl Garden Phase I and Phase II and Oriental Garden Phase
I have all been completed in prior years as well as Yangzhou Palace projects has been completed during the third quarter of fiscal
2019, therefore only limited models are available for customer selection, which limited our ability to promote our existing house
model to broader range of customers and resulted in lower sales for current year. The sales tax for fiscal 2020 increased by 44.8 
from fiscal 2019, due to more surcharge tax charged for the completed real estate properties during fiscal 2020. 

29 

Revenue recognized for condominium
real estate projects under development 

We started to recognize revenue under the
percentage of completion method for Yangzhou Palace real estate project since second quarter of fiscal 2017. For the year ended
September 30, 2020, there was no revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method, because Yangzhou Palace real
estate project was completed by September 30, 2019 and our current real estate projects under development in Liangzhou Road
and related project under development as of September 30, 2020 have not met the criteria for revenue recognition under the
percentage of completion method.

Our cost of sales consists primarily of
costs associated with land use rights and construction costs. Cost of sales are capitalized and allocated to development projects
using a specific identification method. Costs are allocated to specific units within a project based on the ratio of the sales
area of units to the estimated total sales area of the project or phase of the project times the total cost of the project or phase
of the project. 

Cost of sales was approximately 9.4 million
for the year ended September 30, 2020 compared to 30.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The 69 decrease
in cost of sales was mainly attributable to the decrease in total GFA sold for Oriental Pearl Garden, Mingzhu Garden (Nanyuan and
Beiyuan) Phase I and II and Yang County Yangzhou Palace project during fiscal 2020 which led to decreased revenue and cost
of sales during fiscal 2020. 

30 

Land use rights cost: The cost of land
use rights includes the land premium we pay to acquire land use rights for our property development sites, plus taxes. Our land
use rights cost varies for different projects according to the size and location of the site and the minimum land premium set for
the site, all of which are influenced by government policies, as well as prevailing market conditions. Costs for land use rights
for the year ended September 30, 2020 were approximately 0.8 million, as compared to 2.7 million for the year ended September 30,
2019, representing a decrease of 1.8 million from last year. The decrease in costs of land use rights was due to less GFA sold
during fiscal 2020. 

Construction cost: We outsource the
construction of all of our projects to third party contractors, whom we select through a competitive tender process. Our construction
contracts provide a fixed payment which covers substantially all labor, materials and equipment costs, subject to adjustments for
some types of excess, such as design changes during construction or changes in government-suggested steel prices, which are paid
over the construction period based on specified milestones. In addition, we purchase and supply a limited range of fittings and
equipment, including elevators, window frames and door frames. Our construction costs for the year ended September 30, 2020
were approximately 8.5 million as compared to approximately 27.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2019, representing
a decrease of 10.0 million. The decrease in construction cost was due to the decrease in units sold in fiscal 2020. 

Gross profits 

Gross profit was approximately 0.7 million
for the year ended September 30, 2020 as compared to approximately 9.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2019,
representing a decrease of approximately 8.6 million, which was mainly attributable to less GFA sold in Oriental Pearl Garden
and Yang County Yangzhou Palace project during fiscal 2020 and addition impairment of 2.7 million recognized during the year.
We have only limited models available for customer selection in Oriental Pearl Garden project and Yangzhou Yangzhou Palace project,
therefore, the sales from these completed projects decreased from last year. For fiscal 2020, our average selling price ASP for real estate projects (excluding sales of parking spaces) located in Yang County was approximately 719 per square meter, consistent
from the ASP of 720 per square meter for fiscal 2019. The ASP of our Hanzhong real estate projects (excluding sales of parking
spaces) was approximately 419 per square meter for fiscal 2020, decreased by 25.2 as compared to the ASP of 560 per square meter
for fiscal 2019. The decrease ASP in Hanzhong real estate projects was mainly due to the fact that many units sold in fiscal 2020
was for government s reallocation of residence purpose with lower selling price. 

The overall gross profit as a
percentage of real estate sales was 5.5 for the year ended September 30, 2020, decreased from 23.3 for the year ended
September 30, 2019, was mainly due to the additional impairment loss of 2.7 million recognized for the year ended September 30, 2020.

Total operating expenses decreased by 8.0 
or approximately 0.3 million to approximately 2.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 from approximately 3.2
million for the year ended September 30, 2019, as a result of a decrease in general administrative expense of approximately
 0.3 million, but offset with a slight increase in selling expense of 0.1 million. The Company incurred more marketing expense
in fiscal 2020 to promote the sales in Yangzhou Palace project, which resulted higher selling expense in last year. The 0.3 million
decrease in general and administrative expense was due to less consulting and professional fee incurred for the year ended September 30,

Other income, net 

For the year ended September 30, 2020,
the Company had net other income of 1.4 million due to the fact that the Company disposed certain real estate properties in the
existing real estate property completed and under-development to suppliers with settlement of their related payables. For the year
ended September 30, 2019, the Company incurred net other expense of 0.3 million for certain non-operating related expenditures. 

Income taxes 

U.S. Taxes 

China HGS is a Florida corporation. However,
all of our operations are conducted solely by our subsidiaries in the PRC. No income is earned in the United States and we do not
repatriate any earnings outside the PRC. As a result, we did not generate any U.S. taxable income for the years ended September 30,
2020 and 2019. 

For the year ended September 30, 2020,
the income tax provision was approximately 0.8 million, decreased from approximately 2.0 million in fiscal 2019 due to loss incurred
in fiscal 2020. 

Recent U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly
referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the U.S. Tax Reform ), was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The
U.S. Tax Reform significantly modified the U.S. Internal Revenue Code by, among other things, reducing the statutory U.S. federal
corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017; limiting and/or eliminating
many business deductions; migrating the U.S. to a territorial tax system with a one-time transition tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation
of previously deferred foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries; subject to certain limitations, generally eliminating
U.S. corporate income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; and providing for new taxes on certain foreign earnings. Taxpayers
may elect to pay the one-time transition tax over eight years or in a single lump sum. The U.S. Tax Reform also includes provisions
for a new tax on GILTI effective for tax years of foreign corporations beginning after December 31, 2017. The GILTI provisions
impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of controlled foreign corporations CFCs ),
subject to the possible use of foreign tax credits and a deduction equal to 50 percent to offset the income tax liability, subject
to some limitations. For the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company recognized a one-time transition toll tax of approximately
 2.3 million that represented management s estimate of the amount of U.S. corporate income tax based on the deemed repatriation
to the United States of the Company s share of previously deferred earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and VIE of the
Company mandated by the U.S. Tax Reform. The Company s estimate of the onetime transition toll Tax is subject to the finalization
of management s analysis related to certain matters, such as developing interpretations of the provisions of the Tax Act
and amounts related to the earnings and profits of certain foreign VIEs and the filing of our tax returns. U.S. Treasury regulations,
administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting the Tax Act may require further adjustments and changes in our estimates.
As of September 30, 2020, the Company provided an additional 1.0 million provision due to delinquent U.S. tax return fillings. 

32 

PRC Taxes 

Our Company is governed by the Enterprise
Income Tax Law of the People s Republic of China concerning private-run enterprises, which are generally subject to tax at
a statutory rate of 25 on income reported in the statutory financial statements after appropriate tax adjustments. For years ended
September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company is subject to income tax rate of 25 on taxable income. Although the possibility
exists for reinterpretation of the application of the tax regulations by higher tax authorities in the PRC, potentially overturning
the decision made by the local tax authority, the Company has not experienced any reevaluation of the income taxes for prior years.
The PRC tax rules are different from the local tax rules and the Company is required to comply with local tax rules.
The difference between the two tax rules will not be a liability of the Company. There will be no further tax payments for
the difference. 

Net income 

We reported approximately net income of
 1.0 million in net income for the year ended September 30, 2020, representing a decrease of 73.5 or approximately 2.7 million
as compared to net income of approximately 3.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The decrease in net income
was mainly due to less GFA sold during fiscal 2020. 

Other comprehensive income 

We operate primarily in the PRC and the
functional currency of our operating subsidiary is the Chinese Renminbi RMB ). The RMB is not freely convertible
into foreign currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions. No representation
is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into USD at the rates used in translation. 

Translation adjustments amounted to approximately
 8.6 million and negative 6.7 million for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The balance
sheet amounts with the exception of equity at September 30, 2020 were translated at 6.7896 RMB to 1.00 USD as compared to
7.1477 RMB to 1.00 USD at September 30, 2019. The equity accounts were stated at their historical rate. The average translation
rates applied to the income statements accounts for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were 7.0056 RMB to 1.00 USD
and 6.8753 RMB to 1.00 USD, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our principal need for liquidity and capital
resources is to maintain working capital sufficient to support our operations and to make capital expenditures to finance the growth
of our business. Historically we mainly financed our operations primarily through cash flows from operations and borrowings from
our principal shareholder. 

In recent years, the Chinese government
has implemented measures to control overheating residential and commercial property prices including but not limited to restriction
on home purchase, increase the down-payment requirement against speculative buying, development of low-cost rental housing property
to help low-income groups while reducing the demand in the commercial housing market, increase the real estate property tax to
discourage speculation, and control of the land supply and slowdown the construction land auction process, etc. In addition,
in December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) surfaced. COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout China and worldwide,
which has caused significant volatility in the PRC and international markets. There is significant uncertainty around the breadth
and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the PRC and international economies. To reduce
the spread of the COVID-19, the Chinese government has employed measures including city lockdowns, quarantines, travel restrictions,
suspension of business activities and school closures. Due to difficulties resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, including, but
not limited to, the temporary closure of the Company s facilities and operations beginning in early February through
early March 2020, limited support from the Company s employees, delayed access to construction raw material supplies,
reduced customer visit to the Company s sales office, and inability to promote the real estate property sales to customers
on a timely basis, our revenue decreased by approximately 27.0 million in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due to decreased
sales volume of both residential and commercial properties developed by us. Based on assessment of current economic environment,
customer demand and sales trend, and the negative impact from COVID-19 outbreak and spread, we believe that the real estate market
downturn will continue to be uncertain in the coming periods. As a result, the developing period of real estate properties and
our operating cycle has been extended and we may not be able to liquidate our large balance of completed real estate property within
a short term as we originally expected. In addition, as of September 30, 2020, we had large construction loans payable balance
of approximately 109.9 million and large accounts payable balance of approximately 25.4 million to be paid to subcontractors
within one year. The above mentioned facts raised substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern
from the date of this filing. 

33 

In assessing its liquidity, management
monitors and analyzes the Company s cash on-hand, its ability to generate sufficient revenue sources in the future, and its
operating and capital expenditure commitments. As of September 30, 2020, our total cash and restricted cash balance decreased
to approximately 3.9 million as compared to approximately 4.2 million as of September 30, 2019. With respect to capital
funding requirements, the Company budgeted our capital spending based on ongoing assessments of needs to maintain adequate cash.
As of September 30, 2020, we had approximately 109.0 million completed residential apartments and commercial units available
for sale to potential buyers when needed. Although we reported approximately 25.4 million accounts payable as of September 30,
2020, due to the long term relationship with our construction suppliers and subcontractors, we were able to effectively manage
cash spending on construction and negotiate with them to adjust the payment schedule based on our cash on hand. In addition, most
of our existing real estate development projects related to old town renovation which are supported by local government. As of
September 30, 2020, we reported approximately 109.9 million construction loan borrowed from financial institutions controlled
by local government and such loans can only be used on old town renovation related project development. We expect that we will
be able to renew all of the existing construction loans upon their maturity and borrow additional new loans from local financial
institutions when necessary, based on our past experience and the Company s good credit history. Also, the Company s
cash flows from pre-sales and current sales should provide financial support for our current developments and operations. As of
September 30, 2020, we had approximately 19.4 million customer deposits representing cash advance from buyers for pre-sales
of our residential units and we believe such cash advance can be used to fund our ongoing construction projects whenever necessary.
For the year ended September 30, 2020, we had five large ongoing construction projects, which were under preliminary development
stage due to delayed inspection and acceptance of the development plans by local government. In June 2020, we completed the
residence relocation surrounding Liangzhou Road related projects and expects to construct the Liangzhou Road related projects starting
from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. For other four projects, we expect we will be able to obtain government s approval
of the development plans on these projects in the coming fiscal year and start the pre-sale of the real estate property to generate
cash when certain property development milestones have been achieved. For the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the
Company had positive cash flow from operating activities. In addition, our principal shareholder, Mr. Xiaojun Zhu has been
providing and has committed to continue to provide his personal funds to support the Company s operation whenever necessary.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

As an industry practice, the Company provides
guarantees to PRC banks with respect to loans procured by the purchasers of the Company s real estate properties for the
total mortgage loan amount until the completion of obtaining the Certificate of Ownership of the properties from
the government, which generally takes six to twelve months. Because the banks provide loan proceeds without getting the Certificate
of Ownership as loan collateral during this six to twelve months period, the mortgage banks require the Company to
maintain, as restricted cash, 5 to 10 of the mortgage proceeds as security for the Company s obligations under such guarantees.
If a purchaser defaults on its payment obligations, the mortgage bank may deduct the delinquent mortgage payment from the security
deposit and require the Company to pay the excess amount if the delinquent mortgage payments exceed the security deposit. If the
delinquent mortgage payments exceed the security deposit, the banks may require us to pay the excess amount. If multiple purchasers
default on their payment obligations at around the same time, we will be required to make significant payments to the banks to
satisfy our guarantee obligations. If we are unable to resell the properties underlying defaulted mortgages on a timely basis or
at prices higher than the amounts of our guarantees and related expenses, we will suffer financial losses. The Company has made
necessary reserves in its restricted cash account to cover any potential mortgage defaults as required by the mortgage lenders.
For the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company has not experienced any delinquent mortgage loans and has not
experienced any losses related to this guarantee. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, our outstanding guarantees in respect
of our customers' mortgage loans amounted to approximately 68 million and 78 million, respectively. As of September 30,
2020 and 2019, the amount of security deposits provided for these guarantees was approximately 3.4 million and 3.9 million respectively
and the Company believes that such reserves are sufficient. 

Inflation 

Inflation has not had a material impact
on our business and we do not expect inflation to have a material impact on our business in the near future.

Critical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates 

Revenue recognition 

The Company adopted FASB ASC Topic 606
Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 on October 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Under
ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, revenue is recognized in accordance with the transfer of goods and services to
customers at an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to for those goods and services.
The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: 

identification
of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; 

identification
of the performance obligations in the contract; 

determination
of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; 

allocation
of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 

recognition
of revenue when (or as) the Group satisfy a performance obligation. 

Most of the Company s revenue is
derived from real estate sales of condominiums and commercial property in the PRC. The majority of the Company s contracts
contain a single performance obligation involving significant real estate development activities that are performed together to
deliver a real estate property to customers. Revenues arising from real estate sales are recognized when or as the control of the
asset is transferred to the customer. The control of the asset may transfer over time or at a point in time. For the sales of individual
condominium units in a real estate development project, the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed
to date, revenue is recognized over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation percentage completion method ). Otherwise, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains control
of the asset. 

Under percentage completion method, revenue
and profit from the sales of long term real estate development properties is recognized by the percentage of completion method
on the sale of individual units when all the following criteria are met: 

a. Construction is beyond a preliminary stage. 

b. The buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a refund except for non-delivery
of the unit or interest. 

c. Sufficient units have already been sold to assure that
the entire property will not revert to rental property. 

d. Sales prices are collectible. 

e. Aggregate sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably
estimated. 

If any of the above criteria is not met,
proceeds shall be accounted for as deposits until the criteria are met. 

Under the percentage of completion method,
revenues from individual real estate condominium units sold under development and related costs are recognized over the course
of the construction period, based on the completion progress of a project. The progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance
obligation is measured based on the Company s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of the performance obligation, by reference
to the contract costs incurred up to the end of reporting period as a percentage of total estimated costs for each contract. In
relation to any project, revenue is determined by calculating the ratio of incurred costs, including land use rights costs and
construction costs, to total estimated costs and applying that ratio to the contracted sales amounts. Cost of sales is recognized
by determining the ratio of contracted sales during the period to total estimated sales value, and applying that ratio to the incurred
costs. Current period amounts are calculated based on the difference between the life-to-date project totals and the previously
recognized amounts. 

Any changes in significant judgments and/or
estimates used in determining construction and development revenue could significantly change the timing or amount of construction
and development revenue recognized. Changes in total estimated project costs or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in
which they are determined. 

Revenue from the sales of completed real
estate condominium units is recognized at the time of the closing of an individual unit sale. This occurs when the customer obtains
the physical possession, the legal title, or the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the assets and the Company has present
right to payment and the collection of the consideration is probable. For municipal road construction projects, fees are generally
recognized at the time of the projects are completed. 

Contract balances 

Timing of revenue recognition may differ
from the timing of billing and cash receipts from customers. The Company records a contract asset when revenue is recognized prior
to invoicing, or a contract liability when cash is received in advance of recognizing revenue. A contract asset is a right to consideration
that is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time. Contract assets include billed and billable receivables, which
are the Company s unconditional rights to consideration other than to the passage of time. Contract liabilities include cash
collected in excess of revenues. Customer deposit are excluded from contract liabilities. 

The Company has elected to apply the optional
practical expedient for costs to obtain a contract which allows the Company to immediately expense sales commissions (included
under selling expenses) because the amortization period of the asset that the Company otherwise would have used is one year or
less. Contract assets and liabilities are generally classified as current based on our contract operating cycle. 

36 

The Company provides mortgage loan
guarantees only with respect to buyers who make down-payments of 20 -50 of the total purchase price of the property. The
period of the mortgage loan guarantee begins on the date the bank approves the buyer s mortgage and we receive the loan proceeds
in our bank account and ends on the date the Certificate of Ownership evidencing that title to the property has been
transferred to the buyer. The procedures to obtain the Certificate of Ownership take six to twelve months (the Mortgage
Loan Guarantee Period ). If, after investigation of the buyer s income and other relevant factors, the bank decides
not to grant the mortgage loan, our mortgage-loan based sales contract terminates and there will be no guarantee obligation. If,
during the Mortgage Loan Guarantee Period, the buyer defaults on his or her monthly mortgage payment for three consecutive months,
we are required to return the loan proceeds back to the bank, although we have the right to keep the customer's deposit and resell
the property to a third party. Once the Certificate of Property has been issued by the relevant government authority, our loan
guarantee terminates. If the buyer then defaults on his or her mortgage loan, the bank has the right to take the property back
and sell it and use the proceeds to pay off the loan. The Company is not liable for any shortfall that the bank may incur in this
event. To date, no buyer has defaulted on his or her mortgage payments during the Mortgage Loan Guarantee Period and the Company
has not returned any loan proceeds pursuant to its mortgage loan guarantees. 

Use of estimates 

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the assumptions and estimates used by management in recognizing development
revenue under the percentage of completion method, the selection of the useful lives of property and equipment, provision necessary
for contingent liabilities, revenue recognition, taxes and budgeted costs. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing
its consolidated financial statements are reasonable and prudent. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Real estate property development completed
and under development 

Real estate property consists of finished
residential unit sites, commercial offices and residential unit sites under development. The Company leases the land for the residential
unit sites under land use right leases with various terms from the PRC government. The cost of land use rights is included in the
development cost and allocated to each project. Real estate property development completed and real estate property under development
are stated at the lower of cost or fair value. 

Expenditures for land development, including
cost of land use rights, deed tax, pre-development costs, and engineering costs, exclusive of depreciation, are capitalized and
allocated to development projects by the specific identification method. Costs are allocated to specific units within a project
based on the ratio of the sales area of units to the estimated total sales area of the project (or phase of the project) multiplied
by the total cost of the project (or phase of the project). 

Cost of amenities transferred to buyers
is allocated to specific units as a component of total construction cost. The amenity cost includes landscaping, road paving, etc.
Once the projects are completed, the amenities are under control of the property management companies. 

Real estate property development completed
and under development are subject to valuation adjustments when the carrying amount exceeds fair value. An impairment loss is
recognized only if the carrying amount of the assets is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying amount is not recoverable
if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. The Company reviewed all of its real
estate projects for future losses and impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows for each project to
the carrying value of such project. For the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized 2,703,031 and nil impairment for real estate property completed, respectively. 

37 

Capitalization of Interest 

Interest incurred during and directly related
to real estate development projects is capitalized to the related real estate property under development during the active development
period, which generally commences when borrowings are used to acquire real estate assets and ends when the properties are substantially
complete or the property becomes inactive. Interest is capitalized based on the interest rate applicable to specific borrowings
or the weighted average of the rates applicable to other borrowings during the period. Interest capitalized to real estate property
under development is recorded as a component of cost of real estate sales when related units are sold. All other interest is expensed
as incurred.
