Although
the majority of our business activity is carried out in Euros, we report our financial statements in U.S. dollars USD ).
The conversion of Euros and USD leads to period-to-period fluctuations in our reported USD results arising from changes in the
exchange rate between the USD and the Euro. Generally, when the USD strengthens relative to the Euro, it has an unfavorable impact
on our reported revenue and income and a favorable impact on our reported expenses. Conversely, when the USD weakens relative
to the Euro, it produces a favorable impact on our reported revenue and income, and an unfavorable impact on our reported expenses.
These fluctuations in the USD/Euro exchange rate therefore result in currency translation effects (not to be confused with real
currency exchange effects), which impact our reported USD results and may make it difficult to determine actual increases and
decreases in our revenue and expenses that are attributable to our actual operating activities. We carry out our business activities
primarily in Euros, and we do not currently engage in hedging activities. 

The
following table shows the average USD equivalent of the major currencies used to translate our financial results for the years
ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:

Comparison
of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 

Revenue 

We
generate revenues primarily through providing CPaaS solutions to enterprises, communications service providers, early-stage innovators,
developers, IoT, and telecommunications infrastructure providers. Our solutions are hosted software solutions that generate hosting
and subscription revenue. We also offer customer support and professional services related to implementing and supporting our
suite of applications. We offer managed services and bundled services for our mobile solutions services. Managed service revenues
are recognized monthly based on an average number of end-users managed and is calculated based on a pre-determined service fee
per user. For bundled services, we provide both network administration as well as mobile airtime management services. Bundled
service revenue is recognized monthly based on an average number of end-users of managed and mobile airtime usage, calculated
based on a pre-determined service fee. We also earn revenue from telecommunications services we offer, which revenue is based
on a pre-determined rate and number of user minutes and calls that we manage in a given month. We also earn revenue from professional
services, including consulting services to support business process mapping, configuration, data migration, integration and training. 

Our
total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were 62.0 million, an increase of 41.8 million, or 206 , compared to 20.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to the Company s inclusion of a full year of
revenues of Artilium following the acquisition of Artilium in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the addition of iPass revenues following
the iPass acquisition in the first quarter of 2019. 

Cost
of Revenues 

Cost
of revenues includes origination, termination, network and billing charges from telecommunications operators, costs of telecommunications
service providers, network costs, data center costs, facility cost of hosting network and equipment and cost in providing resale
arrangements with long distance service providers, cost of leasing transmission facilities, international gateway switches for
voice, data transmission services, and the cost of professional services of staff directly related to the generation of revenues,
consisting primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including share-based compensation and the cost
of subcontractors. Cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization. 

Cost of revenues for the year ended December
31, 2019 was 47.1 million, an increase of 37.1 million, or 369 , compared to 10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Similar to the increase in revenues, the increase in cost of revenues in 2019 was primarily due to Company s acquisitions
of Artilium and iPass. 

Product
Development 

Product
development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based compensation expenses, of employees
involved in the development of the Company s services, which are expensed as incurred. Costs such as database architecture,
and Pareteum BOSS IN platform development and testing are included in this function. 

Costs incurred during the application development
stage of internal-use software projects, such as those used in the Company s operations, are capitalized in accordance with
the accounting guidance for costs of computer software developed for internal use. Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line
basis. When assigning useful lives to internal-use software, the Company considers the effects of obsolescence, competition, technology,
and other economic factors. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company capitalized 6.4 million and 1.3 million,
respectively, of internal-use software. 

Product development expenses for the years
ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 13.0 million and 3.1 million, respectively, an increase of 9.9 million, or 320 , primarily
due to the incremental product developments costs of the iPass business acquired in 2019. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Sales
and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based compensation expenses, for our
sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners and marketing programs. Marketing programs consist of advertising,
events, corporate communications and brand building. 

32 

Sales and marketing expenses for the years
ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 10.3 million and 3.2 million, respectively, an increase of 7.1 million, or 224 . The increase
was due to additions to the sales force as well as the inclusion of the Artilium and iPass sales and marketing expenses in 2019. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses are our largest cost, other than our impairment charge, and consist primarily of salaries and related
expenses, including share-based compensation, for non-employee directors, finance and accounting, legal and human resources personnel,
legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses. 

General and administrative expenses for
the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 34.6 million and 17.3 million, respectively, an increase of 17.3 million, or
100 . An increase in non-cash compensation, staff-related costs and the addition of Artilium and iPass resulted in higher
general administrative expenses of 5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018.
In 2019, the Company worked to decrease the compensatory costs from Artilium through identified synergies as a result of the acquisition. 

Restructuring
and Acquisition Costs 

Restructuring and acquisition costs for
the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 3.5 million and 7.3 million, respectively, a decrease of 3.8 million or 52 .
The acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were 3.5 million related to our acquisition of iPass compared to 7.1
million related to our acquisition of Artilium in 2018. 

Impairment
of goodwill and intangible assets 

During
the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test. Based on results of the goodwill impairment
test, the Company determined that the estimated fair values of two of the Company s three operating segments, Artilium and
iPass, were less than their carrying values. As a result, the Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 129.1
million during the year ended December 31, 2019 to write down the carrying value of its goodwill from 139.2 million to 10.1
million. In determining the estimated fair value of its reporting unit, the Company used the income approach. Under the income
approach, the fair value is based on the present value of discounted cash flows projected which includes assumptions about revenue
growth rates, operating margins and terminal growth rates discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital derived
from other publicly traded companies that are similar but not identical from an operational and economic standpoint. The primary
factor contributing to the reduction in the fair value of the Company s reporting unit was a significant decline in projected
long-term cash flow projections following the below expectations performance of Artilium and iPass during 2019, which the Company
primarily attributes to disruptions caused by an uncertain economic environment. 

Based
on the Company s review for impairment of intangible assets, the Company determined that the carrying values exceeded the
fair values by 31.9 million. As a result, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of 31.9 million during the year
ended December 31, 2019 to write down the carrying value of certain intangible assets to 15.5 million. The primary factor contributing
to the impairment charge was the significant decline in projected long-term cash flow projections which the Company primarily
attributes to disruptions caused by an uncertain economic environment. 

Depreciation
and Amortization 

Depreciation
and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 12.9 million and 5.4 million, an increase of 7.5 million,
or 138 . The increase is primarily due to the amortization of the intangible assets acquired through the acquisitions of Artilium
and iPass. 

Interest
Income 

Interest
income increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 2.1 million and 0.3 million, respectively, an increase of 1.8 million.
The increase results primarily from borrowings under that certain credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with Post
Road Administrative Finance, LLC and its affiliate Post Road Special Opportunity Fund I LLP (the Post Road Loan entered into February 2019, which was subsequently paid off in conjunction with a securities purchase agreement entered into in
September 2019. (see Note 15, Stockholders Equity Securities Purchase Agreement ). 

33 

Interest
Expense Related to Debt Discount and Conversion Feature 

For
the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, interest expenses related to debt discount and conversion features of certain of our
exercisable and convertible securities was 0.6 million and 0.2 million, respectively, an increase of 0.4 million. The increase
was primarily attributable to the issuance of the Post Road Loan Facility in February 2019 that was subsequently paid off in conjunction
with a securities purchase agreement entered into in September 2019. (see Note 15, Stockholders Equity 
Securities Purchase Agreement ). 

Changes
in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities 

In
2018, we recognized a revaluation gain of 1.3 million on derivative liabilities associated with a promissory note that was settled
in the third quarter of 2018. We did not have a similar transaction in 2019. 

Loss
on Extinguishment of Debt 

In
2019, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 8.9 million related to the extinguishment of Post Road Loan and Fortress
Credit Agreement in September 2019 (see Note 12, Long-term Debt ). 

Gain
on Equity Investment 

In
2018, we recognized a gain on equity investment that represents the gain in our equity investment in Artilium at its carrying
value of 3.2 million at the time of our acquisition of Artilium compared to its acquisition-date fair value of 9.6 million.
There is no comparable transaction in 2019. 

Amortization
of Deferred Financing Costs 

Amortization
of deferred financing costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 0.2 million, compared to a de minimis amount in the same
period in 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of the Post Road Loan in February 2019 that was subsequently
paid off in September 2019. 

Other
Income (expense), net 

Other income (expense) net, is generated
from non-operating activities and includes foreign currency gains and losses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company
recorded other expense, net of 3.2 million compared to other income, net of 0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The decrease of 3.8 million was primarily due to the recognition of a reserve on a note receivable and the favorable impact of
foreign exchange rates on our results in 2018 when compared to 2019. 

Income
Taxes Benefit 

Income
 tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 8.3
 million and 0.2 million,
respectively. This change was primarily due to the full valuation of the deferred tax liability resulting from the Artilium acquisition.
On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Artilium and as a result of the purchase price allocation, the Company
recorded a net deferred tax liability of 8.6 million for the basis difference on acquired intangible assets and tax attributes
from the business combination. The total tax-effected intangible impairment for Artilium in 2019 totaled 17.2 million. 

Other
Comprehensive Loss 

We
 record foreign
currency translation gains and losses as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency translation loss
for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 0.2 million and
 0.2 million, respectively.

Quarterly
Results of Operations Discussion: 

Revenues 

Comparison
of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018. 

Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was 13.1 million, a 9.4 million or 258 increase compared to 3.7 million
for the comparable three months in 2018. Our deployments with existing customers continue to grow, new implementations generated
new revenues and new cloud-based revenues were all factors in our revenue growth. Additionally, revenues include 8.9 million
in revenues from Artilium and iPass which were acquired in October 2018 and February 2019, respectively. Comparable revenues were
not reflected in the three months ended March 31, 2018, because these subsidiaries were acquired in subsequent periods. 

Comparison
of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018. 

Revenues
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were 16.9
 million and 29.9 million;
a 13.0 million and 22.4 million,
respectively, or 335 and 298 ,
respectively, increase compared to 3.9 million and 7.5 million,
respectively, for the comparable three and six months in 2018. The increase was primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass
that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018. 

Cost
of Revenues 

Cost
of revenues includes origination, termination, network and billing charges from telecommunications operators, costs of telecommunications
service providers, network costs, data center costs, facility cost of hosting network and equipment and cost in providing resale
arrangements with long distance service providers, cost of leasing transmission facilities, international gateway switches for
voice, data transmission services, and the cost of professional services of staff directly related to the generation of revenues,
consisting primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including share-based compensation and the cost
of subcontractors. Cost of service excludes depreciation and amortization. 

Comparison
of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018. 

Cost of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was
 8.0 million, an increase of 6.8 million or 571 , compared to 1.2 million for the comparable three-month period in 2018. For
the three months ended March 31, 2019, this includes 5.0 million of cost of revenues for Artilium and iPass. Comparable costs
were not reflected in the three months ended March 31, 2018, because these subsidiaries were acquired in subsequent periods. 

Comparison
of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018. 

Cost of revenues for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2019 was 12.6 million and 20.7 million, respectively, an increase of 10.8 million and 17.7 million,
respectively, or 589 and 581 , respectively, compared to 1.8 million and 3.0 million, respectively, for the comparable three-
and six-month periods in 2018. The increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred
subsequent to the same period in 2018 and volume in revenue growth. 

Product
Development 

Product
development costs consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based expenses, of employees involved in
the development of the Company s services, which are expensed as incurred. Costs such as database architecture, and Pareteum
BOSS IN platform development and testing are included in this function. 

36 

Comparison
of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018. 

Product
development costs for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were 2.6 million
and 0.7 million, respectively, an increase of 1.8 million
or 251 . The increase is primarily due to the overall expansion of
our lines of business year over year and the inclusion of product development costs of 0.8 million for Artilium and iPass for
the three months ended March 31, 2019. Comparable costs were not reflected in the three months ended March 31, 2018, because these
subsidiaries were acquired in subsequent periods.

development costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were 3.6 million
and 6.2 million, respectively, an increase of 2.8 million
and 4.6 million, respectively, or 351 and
 303 , respectively, compared to 0.8 million
and 1.5 million, respectively, for the comparable three- and six-month
periods in 2018. The increase was due to the overall expansion of our lines of business year over year. The increase in product
development costs is primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018 and
overall expansion of our lines of business year over year. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Sales
and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based expenses, for our sales and marketing
staff, including commissions, payments to partners and marketing programs. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events,
corporate communications and brand building. 

Comparison
of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018. 

Sales
and marketing expenses for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were 2.9 million
and 0.7 million, respectively, an increase of 2.2 million
or 317 . This increase is primarily a direct result of hiring new
employees, the inclusion of the Artilium and iPass sales and marketing expenses of 0.9 million, and other incremental costs incurred
as the Company expanded. 

Comparison
of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018. 

Sales
and marketing expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were 3.1 million
and 6.0 million, respectively, an increase of 2.3 million
and 4.5 million, respectively, or 283 and 299 , respectively, compared to 0.8 million and 1.5 million, respectively, for the
comparable three- and six-month periods in 2018. The increase in sales and
marketing expenses is primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018 and
 hiring new employees and allocating resources to growing our business. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses are typically our largest cost and consist primarily of overhead related salaries and expenses, including
share-based compensation, for non-employee directors, finance and accounting, legal, internal audit and human resources personnel,
legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses. 

Comparison
of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018. 

General and administrative expenses for the three-month period
ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were 7.9 million and 1.8 million, respectively, an increase of 6.1 million or 334 . These increases
were primarily due to the inclusion of general and administrative expenses for Artilium and iPass of 3.6 million and increase
in personnel costs including share-based compensation expense. 

Comparison
of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018. 

General
and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were 8.4 million
and 16.3 million, respectively, an increase of 6.1 million
and 12.2 million, respectively, or 271 and 299 , respectively, compared to 2.3 million and 4.1 million, respectively, for the
comparable three- and six-month periods in 2018. The increase in general
and administrative expenses is primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in
2018 and increase in personnel costs including share-based compensation expense. 

Restructuring
and Acquisition Charges 

Comparison
of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018. 

Restructuring and acquisition charges for
the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were 3.3 million and 0.1 million, an increase of 3.2 million. The costs incurred
in 2019 were primarily the result of the iPass acquisition which was completed on February 12, 2019. 

37 

Comparison
of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018. 

Restructuring
and acquisition charges for the three months ended June 30, 2019 were 0.1 million.
Restructuring and acquisition costs of 3.4 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2019 were comprised predominantly of acquisition costs related to the acquisition of iPass that was completed
on February 12, 2019 and to a lesser extent, restructuring charges following the acquisitions of Artilium and iPass. 

Restructuring
and acquisition charges for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2018 were not significant. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As reflected in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements, the Company reported net losses of 226.8 million and 18.0 million for the years ended 2019 and 2018, respectively,
and had an accumulated deficit of 543.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and 317.1 million as of December 31, 2018. During the
fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 129.1 million and intangible assets impairment
of 31.9 million. 

The
cash balance, including restricted cash and cash, of the Company at December 31, 2019 was 5.9 million. As of December 31, 2018 ,
 our cash balance, including restricted cash, was 6.5 million. 

On
June 8, 2020, we issued a 17.5 million 8 Senior Secured Convertible Note (the High Trail Note to High Trail
Investments SA LLC High Trail due April 1, 2025 for an aggregate purchase price of 14 million, of which 7
million is currently maintained in one or more blocked accounts. The terms of the High Trail Note and related documents
require the Company to meet certain specified conditions and covenants, some of which have not been satisfied by the dates
required, including (i) the Company filing its restated financial statements with the SEC for (a) the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2018, (b) the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and (c) the quarter ended June 30, 2019, in each case on or prior to
October 31, 2020, (ii) after October 31, 2020, the Company timely filing its subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or its
subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K with the SEC in the manner and within the time periods required under the Exchange Act
and (iii) the Company maintaining the listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market. As a result, on December 1,
2020, we entered into a forbearance agreement (the Forbearance Agreement with High Trail under which: (i) we
admitted that we were in default of several obligations under the High Trail Note and related agreements, (ii) High Trail
acknowledged such defaults and agreed not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note or the related securities
purchase agreement, warrant or security documents, including its right to accelerate the aggregate amount outstanding under
the High Trail Note, until the earlier of December 31, 2020 (since extended to March 31, 2021), the date of any new event
of default or initiation of any action by the Company to invalidate any of the representations and warranties made in the
Forbearance Agreement. As a result of the defaults, the interest rate paid on the principal outstanding under the High Trail
Note increased to 18 per annum. As partial consideration for its agreement to not to exercise any right or remedy under the
High Trail financing documents, we agreed with High Trail to make certain changes to the High Trail Note and related
agreements. In this regard, we agreed to delete the Floor Price of 0.10 that had previously limited the number
of shares of Company common stock into which (i) the outstanding indebtedness could be converted upon default and (ii)
payments of interest could be made. We also agreed to increase the number of shares it was required to reserve for issuance
upon conversion of the High Trail Note and to decrease the exercise price of the related warrant from 0.58 to
 0.37. 

On
February 22, 2021, the Company closed the issuance of 2.4 million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Second Lien Secured
Convertible Notes due 2025 (the Second Lien Notes ). The Second Lien Notes were sold under the Securities Purchase
Agreement, dated as of February 22, 2021, entered into by and between the Company and an institutional investor. The aggregate
purchase price for the Second Lien Notes and related warrant to purchase common stock was 2.0 million. The Second Lien Notes
are senior, secured obligations of the Company, but rank junior to the High Trail Note. Interest is payable monthly beginning
April 1, 2021 at a rate of 8 per annum. The Second Lien Notes are secured by a second lien on substantially all assets of the
Company and substantially all assets of its material U.S.-organized subsidiaries. Interest may be paid, at the election of the
Company, in cash or in shares of common stock of the Company; provided, that, so long as the High Trail Note remains outstanding,
such payments may only be made in shares. The number of shares issuable to pay interest in shares is determined by the application
of a formula in which the amount of the interest due is divided by 85 of the lowest volume-weighted average price of the Company s
common stock on the principal market for the Company s common stock over the 10 days preceding the date of such payment. 

Subject
to an intercreditor agreement with the holder of the High Trail Note, upon notice by the Company, the Company may elect to redeem
all or a portion of the then-outstanding principal amount outstanding under the Second Lien Note. The holder of the Second Lien
Note or the Company may also elect for the Company to redeem the Second Lien Notes at a 20 premium if the Company undergoes a
fundamental change. The Second Lien Notes will be convertible into shares of common stock, in part or in whole, from time to time,
at the election of the holder of the Second Lien Notes. The initial conversion rate is 1666.6667 shares of Company common stock
for each 1,000 of principal amount of Second Lien Notes. The conversion rate is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments
in the event the Company issues stock dividends or effects a split or reverse split of the Company s common stock. 

38 

Because
of the limited nature of the relief provided under the Forbearance Agreement, which does not lower the amounts payable in principal
or interest, and the limited amount of additional capital we raised by selling the Second Lien Notes, we believe that we will
not have sufficient resources to fund our operations and meet the obligations specified in the note for the next twelve months
following the filing of this Annual Report. Our software platforms require ongoing funding to continue the current development
and operational plans and we have a history of net losses. We will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable
future in connection with the continued development of our software platforms. These expenditures will include costs associated
with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling of our services.
In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. 

As
a result, we believe that additional capital will be required to fund our operations and provide growth capital to meet the obligations
under the High Trail Note. Accordingly, we will have to raise additional capital in one or more debt and/or equity offerings.
However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the necessary capital or that any such offering will
be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed, this
would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Furthermore, the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly
disrupted world financial markets, has negatively impacted U.S. market conditions and may reduce opportunities for us to seek
out additional funding. In particular, a decline in the market price of our common stock, coupled with the stock s delisting
from the Nasdaq Capital Market, could make it more difficult to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time
and price that we deem appropriate. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going
concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. 

Operating
Activities 

We
reported net cash used in operating activities of 17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net cash used
in operating activities of 7.8 million in 2018, an increase in cash used of 9.9 million. Operating activities decreased primarily
as a result of a decrease in net operating results after the add back of the 161.0 million impairment of goodwill and intangible
assets and 8.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt as well as the amortization of deferred financing costs, share-based compensation,
depreciation and amortization and change in fair value of warrant liability.

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2019, was 11.1 million, a decrease of 0.4 million or 3 , compared
to 11.5 million net cash used in investing activities in 2018. This decrease is a result of an all common stock acquisition of
iPass in the year ended December 31, 2019 partially offset by an increase in capitalized software, notes receivable issued to
a third party, and assets purchased from Devicescape Holdings, Inc. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, was 28.3 million, compared to net cash provided by
financing activities of 12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Financing activities increased as a result of the
Company s issuance of common equity and redeemable preferred stock offset by repayment of loans issued during the current
year and the repayment of debt held by iPass as of the date of the acquisition. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

During
the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into certain off balance sheet commitments that require the future
purchase of goods or services unconditional purchase obligations ). We entered into the Strategic Connectivity Agreement
(the Connectivity Agreement with Hutchison 3G UK Limited 3UK on July 23, 2019. Under the Connectivity
Agreement, we are obligated to pay 3UK 0.6 million for the implementation of a MVNO (the 3UK MVNO ), and for monthly
services provided, based on usage, after the 3UK MVNO is launched, which we anticipate to be in the third quarter of 2021. As
of December 31, 2019, 0.1 million was invoiced by 3UK and is recorded in Accrued expenses and other payables in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019. Of the remaining unconditional purchase obligation to 3UK outstanding as of December 31,
2019, we expect to incur 0.1 million in 2020 and the remainder in 2021. 

39 

Concurrent
with the execution of the Connectivity Agreement, we entered into the Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of Credit Voucher (the
 Credit Voucher Agreement with PCCW Global Limited PCCW under which we are obligated to purchase
a credit voucher for 28.0 million. The credit voucher will be used to offset certain monthly service charges incurred under the
Connectivity Agreement. As of December 31, 2019, 0.6 million of the purchase price has been recorded in Accrued expenses and
other payables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining 27.5 million unconditional purchase obligation is due and payable
following the launch date of the 3UK MVNO, with minimum aggregate payments due as of June 30 th , 2022, 2023, 2024 and
2025. 

See
Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies for additional details about these off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Application
of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Revenue
Recognition and Net billings in Excess of Revenues 

Revenue
represents amounts earned for (non-software) arrangements consisting of hosting subscriptions for our CPaaS solutions. We also
offer customer support and professional services related to implementing and supporting our suite of applications. Revenues generally
are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. 

Monthly
Service Revenues: 

The
Company s performance obligations in monthly Software as a Service (SaaS) and service offerings are simultaneously received
and consumed by the customer and therefore, are recognized over time. For recognition purposes, we do not unbundle such services
into separate performance obligations. The Company typically bills its customer at the end of each month, with payment to be received
shortly thereafter. The fees charged may include a combination of fixed and variable charges with the variable charges tied to
the number of subscribers or some other measure of volume. Although the consideration may be variable, the volumes are estimable
at the time of billing, with true-up adjustments occurring in the subsequent month. Such amounts have not been historically
significant. 

Installation
and Software Development Revenues: 

The
Company s other revenues consist generally of installation and software development projects. 

Installation
represents the activities necessary for a customer to obtain access and connectivity to the Company s monthly SaaS and service
offerings. While installation may require separate phases, it represents one promise within the context of the contract. 

Software
development consists of programming and other services which adds new functionality to a customer s existing or new service
offerings. Each development project defines its milestones and will have its own performance obligation. 

Revenue
is recognized over time if the installation and software development activities create an asset that has no alternative use for
which the Company is entitled to receive payment for performance completed to date. If not, then revenue is not recognized until
the applicable performance obligation is satisfied. 

Arrangements
with Multiple Performance Obligations: 

The
Company s contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates
revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company generally determines standalone
selling prices based on the prices charged to customers. 

Contract
assets and liabilities: 

Given
the nature of the Company s services and contracts, it has no contract assets. The Company records net billings in excess
of revenues when payments are made in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. 

Payment
terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when
payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before control is
transferred or services are delivered to the customer. 

40 

Cost
of Revenues 

Cost
of revenues includes origination, termination, network and billing charges from telecommunications operators, costs of telecommunications
service providers, materials and supplies, network costs, data center costs, facility cost of hosting network and equipment and
cost in providing resale arrangements with long distance service providers, cost of leasing transmission facilities, international
gateway switches for voice, data transmission services, and the cost of professional services of staff directly related to the
generation of revenues, consisting primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including share-based expenses
and the cost of subcontractors. Cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization. 

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts 

We
record an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts in an amount approximating anticipated losses. Accounts receivable
are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with customers. An allowance is recorded on the
basis of loss experience, known and inherent risk in the account balance and current economic conditions. Individual
uncollectible accounts are written off against the allowance when collection of the individual accounts appears
doubtful. 

Income
Taxes 

We
estimate our income taxes separately for each tax jurisdiction in which we conduct operations. The provision for federal, state,
foreign and local income taxes is calculated on income before income taxes based on current tax law and includes the cumulative
effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provision
differs from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different reporting periods
for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. 

We
record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In determining the
net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, we are required to make judgments and estimates in assessing the realizability
of the deferred tax assets. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including
future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent
results of operations. If we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in
excess of their net recorded amount or would no longer be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future as currently
recorded, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would decrease or increase the provision for income taxes. 

Share-based
Compensation 

The
Company follows the provisions of ASC 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation ASC 718 ). Under ASC 718, share-based
awards are recorded at fair value as of the grant date and recognized as expense with an adjustment for forfeiture over the employee s
requisite service period (the vesting period, generally three years), which the Company amortizes on a straight-line basis. 

For
both contractors and advisory board members, we recognize the guidance for share-based compensation awards to non-employees in
accordance with ASC 505-50 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees ASC 505-50 ). Under ASC 505-50, we determine
the fair value of the options or share-based compensation awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received,
or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. 

Share-based
compensation (cash and non-cash) related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors are included within our cost
of revenues and operating expenses. 

Warrant
and Conversion feature derivative liabilities 

Warrants
and convertible notes that are accounted for as derivative liabilities are remeasured at fair value each reporting period in accordance
with the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 ). The Company utilizes the Monte Carlo valuation
model to determine the value of the outstanding warrants and the conversion feature in the convertible notes. Since the Monte
Carlo valuation model requires special software and expertise to model the assumptions to be used, the Company uses a third-party
valuation expert to fair value the derivative liabilities. 

Business
Combinations 

We
generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interests in an acquiree
at their fair values as of the date of acquisition, under the purchase method of accounting. We measure goodwill as the excess
of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant
estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including
the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax
positions, and contingencies. This method also requires us to refine these estimates over a one-year measurement period to reflect
new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected
the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that
we have recorded for the fair value of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could materially
decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet. 

41 

Significant
estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology, customer lists, and other identifiable
intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results
and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop
these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets
and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation
or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed. 

Goodwill
and Intangible Assets Impairment 

Goodwill
is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is defined as
an operating segment, or one level below the operating segment. We operate in one reportable segment. 

We
test for an indication of goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or sooner, when indicators of impairment exist,
by comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If there is an indication of impairment, we perform a
 step two test to measure the impairment. Impairments, if any, are recorded to the statement of operations in the
period the impairment is recognized. 

A
significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators include
a sustained and significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows,
a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate and unanticipated competition. 

In
accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other ASC 350 ), intangible assets are carried at
cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected
useful lives of the assets, between three and ten years. Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with
ASC 350, on an annual basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may
not be recoverable. Measurement of any impairment loss for long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets that management
expects to hold and use, is based on the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the fair value of the asset. 

Contingent
Losses 

From
time to time, during the normal course of operations, we are party to litigation and regulatory matters, claims and other contingent
matters. Litigation and
regulatory reviews can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex proceedings
and reviews are difficult to predict and our view of these matters may change in the future as events related thereto unfold.
We expense legal fees as incurred. We record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability will
be incurred and the amount or range of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal or regulatory
matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company s operations or its financial position, liquidity or results
of operations.
